        <p>
          As a final-year Computer Engineering student with Honors in Machine
          Learning and Data Science from MKSSS Cummins College of Engineering
          for Women, Pune, I have developed a strong foundation in technology. I
          gained hands-on experience through internships at Deutsche Bank, where
          I deployed three critical microservices in a DevOps role, earning a
          quarterly award for being the first intern to achieve this
          recognition. At Reliance Jio, I contributed as a FrontEnd Intern,
          focusing on the design and implementation of their employee portal.
          Currently, I am working on transfer learning models with a focus on
          the attention module, aiming to create a custom model for cancer
          classification as part of my research at the
          <a href="https://www.cmaterju.in/" target="_blank"
            >CMATER Lab, Jadavpur University</a

<h2 style="font-weight: lighter">On-going Work</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Improving Medical Imaging with AI:</strong>  
    I’m working with Dr. Anjali Naik on analyzing X-ray data using convolutional neural networks. The idea is to make medical imaging smarter and more accurate, helping doctors catch issues earlier and with more confidence.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Emotion Detection with EEG Signals:</strong>  
    Alongside Dr. Sandhya Arora, I’m developing models that can detect emotions from brain signals. This could be a game-changer for brain-computer interfaces, making technology more intuitive and responsive to human emotions.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Making EcoBot Smarter:</strong>  
    Building on my work with EcoTrack, I’m fine-tuning chatbot responses using Generative AI and large language models. The goal? A chatbot that’s not just functional but actually helpful in guiding users toward sustainable choices.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Translating Hinglish to English, the Right Way:</strong>  
    I’m exploring better ways to convert Hinglish (that mix of Hindi and English we all use) into proper English using NLP. The challenge is getting it right—capturing context and meaning instead of just doing a word-for-word translation.
