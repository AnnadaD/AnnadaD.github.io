          As a final-year Computer Engineering student with Honors in Machine
          Learning and Data Science from MKSSS Cummins College of Engineering
          for Women, Pune, I have developed a strong foundation in technology. I
          gained hands-on experience through internships at Deutsche Bank, where
          I deployed three critical microservices in a DevOps role, earning a
          quarterly award for being the first intern to achieve this
          recognition. At Reliance Jio, I contributed as a full-stack developer,
          focusing on the design and implementation of their employee portal.
          Currently, I am working on transfer learning models with a focus on
          the attention module, aiming to create a custom model for cancer
          classification as part of my research at the

            <strong>Optimizing EcoBot for Enhanced Responses:</strong>
            As a continuation of my work on EcoTrack, I am focusing on
            optimizing chatbot responses using Generative AI (GenAI) and large
            language models (LLMs). The goal is to create a more efficient,
            accurate, and responsive conversational system to assist users in
            tracking and managing their carbon footprint.

            <strong>Hinglish to English Conversion:</strong>
            I am exploring an optimal approach for converting Hinglish (a blend
            of Hindi and English) to pure English using Natural Language
            Processing (NLP) techniques. The aim is to develop a model that
            accurately handles code-switching and seamlessly translates Hinglish
            phrases into coherent English sentences.
